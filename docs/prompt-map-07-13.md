# Prompt map 07–13, re-scoped — `[RI-6]`

Prompts 07–13 measured against what the engine **actually is** after P1–P6, not against what the original build order assumed. One paragraph each: what it must now contain, and what it inherits from the deferral ledger.

Produced by the midpoint integration review. Ledger states are in `docs/review-midpoint-report.md` §6; findings referenced as R*n* (rehearsal), F*n* (pass 4), H*n* (hardware), S*n* (`/status`).

Note on numbering: the build order names 14 (packaging) and 15 (contrib outputs) beyond this range. They are untouched by this review and remain as written.

## 07 — Graphics and templates (overlays, ticker, clock)

**Inherits three promoted deferrals** — the overlay level itself (§7.10, deferred by P4 naming 07 as owner), §8.7.5's true crossfade via per-source envelopes, and the `sfx` ramp-advance invariant. It also inherits **R1 as P0**: the item→asset audio miss must be at the front of 07's fix list, because a show with no sound is not a foundation to build overlays on. The scope that P4 deferred is unchanged — `View = overlay(transition(A, B))`, overlays composite after the transition and persist across it, and AC-24 (a ticker survives a complex move transition untouched) is the acceptance case. What has changed is the surrounding evidence: 07 now knows the audio graph works in isolation and does not reach a real take, and that per-source envelopes are load-bearing on **both** sides — video overlays and audio crossfade — so they should be designed once. §6.5's forbidding of per-frame relayout and its packaged-font rule are portability assets (`docs/portability.md` row 7) and must not be weakened. R2, R3 and R5 are assigned here too: they are metering and timing work that 07's audio changes will touch anyway.

## 08 — Companion mapping (elevated to a normative requirement)

Per the v0.4 outline §6, 08 is no longer "wire up a Stream Deck." It builds an **Input Intent schema** — a mapping layer that is *data, not code* — from physical intents (Companion button, MIDI note, keyboard chord) to semantic §16 commands, with per-device profiles as user-editable documents. The §16 command surface with token auth and audit is already the device-independent core (`docs/portability.md`, known-good boundary 1), so 08 adds a layer above it and must not add a second command surface beside it. The proof of generality is normative: a keyboard-shortcut adapter ships in the same prompt and must work with **zero** changes to the core. The Input Intent schema is a wire-level contract and takes normative spec text at 08's moment. Target hardware: StreamDeck XL via Companion.

## 09 — Recording

**Owns `marker.add` → recording chapter (§16.11)**, assigned by `[RI-5]` — 09's current doc does not mention it, and its upgrade pass must. Inherits two dormant deferrals that its own benchmark is the trigger for: zero-copy IOSurface→Metal (re-defer *with numbers*, not with prose) and the display surface. §0.1 assumption 14 fixes fragmented MP4 as the crash-safe default. 09 should also carry `[RI-8]`'s pinned residency policy into its own resource accounting: **unload-at-next-load**, so a stop→start recovery does not pay the 46 s reload measured in the report §3.2.

## 10 — Streaming

Inherits the guest-link JWT / `jti` revocation work (§10.7 #1) assigned by `[RI-5]`, and the TURN credential vending shape (§5.1 #11, §9.6.2) whose response has a schema but no derivation rule. WHEP preview (AC-20) is explicitly **post-v1** and not 10's scope — it waits for a WebRTC stack to exist. The mix-minus guarantee 06 built structurally (§8.6, `render_guest_return` has no path reading a guest's own bus) is 10's to preserve when real guests replace test tones.

## 11 — Watchdog

The watchdog itself exists and is gated (pass 4 confirmed deadline accounting and fallback trip both fail correctly when deleted). What 11 must now add is **the automation engine runtime** (§13, AC-25), assigned by `[RI-5]`: triggers, the once-per-frame limit, runtime cycle suppression, and audit logging of every automation action. `automation.hold` exists from Prompt 02; the engine behind it does not. 11 also inherits **F3's fix** as context — the fix round adds a `fail_view` seam, so §10.3's engagement path finally has production coverage that 11's work must keep.

## 12 — Benchmark

**Reframed by H1.** The reference machine is Intel with discrete AMD graphics; the spec declares Apple Silicon the primary target. Every performance number to date — quality-profile capping, the 8 ms render budget, the degradation ladder's thresholds — is unvalidated on the declared target. 12 must state which architecture each measurement was taken on, and AC-5's 30-minute zero-drop soak must not be reported as met on an architecture the spec does not target. S1 is 12's problem too: `renderGpuTimeMs` is always 0, and it is the ladder's input, so the ladder is currently deciding on a constant. A benchmark prompt that inherits a stubbed GPU timer measures nothing.

## 13 — Operator shell

Inherits the display-surface deferral (04 → 09 → here in practice) and S2: **`showState` is absent from the §10.1 telemetry tick**, so a shell subscribing to telemetry alone cannot say whether the show is running. Either the shell also tracks `stateChange` frames, or v0.4 adds the field — the outline records it as a candidate. 13 is also the first consumer that will notice R2's metering strobe: bus meters sampled once a second from a 33 ms window are unusable in an operator UI, so R2's fix is a prerequisite rather than a nicety.

## Cross-cutting, owned by no single prompt

| Item | Where it lands |
|---|---|
| Preflight resource enforcement (H2) | v0.4 outline §3 — schema/contract question, not prompt work |
| `showState` in telemetry (S2) | v0.4 outline §3 — wire contract |
| `viewItemStartFrame` in the resync snapshot | v0.4 outline §2, already confirmed |
| `sequenceRef` | v0.4 outline §5 — review recommends **retire**; evidence absent |
| §12.6 clamp wiring | Re-deferred; trigger is the first Apple Silicon machine or the first >1 GiB loop budget |
